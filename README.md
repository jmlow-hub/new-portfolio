# Hi, I'm Jackie

I'm a junior developer based in Aberdeen, Scotland and this is my portfolio. I'm a career-changer and graduate from the  __nology 12 week software development bootcamp. I truly believe that with dedication and tenacity a career in tech is open to anyone and I'm really looking foward to building on the solid core skills that nology have given me.

You can view my live portfolio site here:      and see some of the projects that I've built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.  I'm also familiar with Java, Spring Boot, firebase and mySQL Workbench.
